# AI For Good 

Hello. 

AI for Good is a team consisting of Celin Tausch, Christian Emil Brosb√∏l, Kathrin Siller, Oxana Gerasimova, and Monika Skurvyde.

We made a COVID-19 test advicer for the TechLabs Digital Shaper project. 

It is shortly demonstrated in the MP file. 

Final design is displayed in the image files. 

Thank you.
